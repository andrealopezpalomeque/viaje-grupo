## Step 1: Get a Phone Number for the Bot

**Time:** 30 minutes (when stores open)

1. Go to any phone carrier store (Claro, Movistar, Personal, etc.)
2. Buy the cheapest prepaid SIM (~$3-5 USD)
3. Activate it (usually automatic or quick call)
4. **Save the number** - you'll need it for verification
5. Keep the SIM safe - you'll receive ONE verification SMS

> 💡 **Tip:** You don't need data or minutes. Just the ability to receive SMS once.

### Option B: eSIM (If Your Phone Supports It)

1. Check if your phone supports eSIM (iPhone XS+, Pixel 3+, etc.)
2. Buy eSIM from carrier or online (Airalo, Holafly, etc.)
3. Add as secondary line
4. Use that number for verification

### Option C: Family Member's Unused Number

1. Find someone with an old number they don't use
2. Make sure it's NOT registered on WhatsApp already
3. Get their permission to use it for your bot

# Update these with new values:

ALLOWED_PHONE_NUMBERS=...    ← DELETE THIS
```

### 5.3 Update Webhook

In Meta App Dashboard → WhatsApp → Configuration:

   ```
   https://viaje-grupo-server.onrender.com/webhook
   ```

   [Your existing WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN]
   ```

## Step 6: Post-Verification Cleanup

### 6.1 Remove Phone Whitelist Code (Optional)

The whitelist check in your code can be removed or made optional:

// In whatsapp.js, find the whitelist check and remove/disable it
// After production, anyone can message the bot
```

### 6.2 Update Documentation

Update these docs to reflect production status:
- `docs/product-status.md` - Change "Closed Beta" to "Production"
- `docs/session-handoff.md` - Update WhatsApp API status
- `README.md` - Remove beta limitations mention

### 6.3 Inform Test Users

Let your test groups know:
- New bot phone number (if changed)
- They may need to save the new contact
- No more whitelist restrictions

## Troubleshooting

### "Business verification rejected"

| Reason | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| Document unclear | Re-upload higher quality scan/photo |
| Name mismatch | Ensure Business Manager name matches ID exactly |
| Address mismatch | Use document with matching address |
| Document expired | Use valid, non-expired ID |

You can re-submit verification after fixing issues.

### "Phone number already registered"

The number is already on WhatsApp. Solutions:
1. Use the existing WhatsApp on that number to delete the account
2. Wait 24-48 hours
3. Try registering again

### "Verification code not received"

1. Make sure the SIM is active and has signal
2. Wait a few minutes and request resend
3. Try voice call verification instead of SMS

### "Webhook not working with new number"

1. Check Phone Number ID is updated in Render
2. Check Access Token is valid and not expired
3. Verify webhook subscription in Meta Dashboard
4. Check Render logs for errors

## Notes

- This guide is for **Argentina** - some details may vary by country
- Meta's review process can be faster or slower depending on volume
- Keep your verification documents - you may need them for appeals
- The bot phone number doesn't need to stay active after verification (API doesn't use the actual SIM)
