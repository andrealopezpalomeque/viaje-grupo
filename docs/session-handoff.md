## 🚀 Quick Start for New Sessions

Paste this at the start of any new Claude conversation:

> I'm working on **Text the Check**, a collaborative expense tracking app where users log expenses via WhatsApp and view balances on a web dashboard.
>
> **Tech Stack:**
> - `/client`: Nuxt.js + Tailwind + Pinia (Firebase Hosting)
> - `/server`: Node.js + Express (Render)
> - Database: Firebase Firestore
> - Bot: WhatsApp Business API
>
> **Live URLs:**
> - Dashboard: https://textthecheck.app
> - Backend: https://viaje-grupo-server.onrender.com
>
> **Current Phase:** Closed Beta Testing with 3 friend groups
>
> See `docs/session-handoff.md` for full context, or I can explain what I need.

## 📋 Project Summary

### What It Does

Users split expenses during trips by texting a WhatsApp bot using **natural language**:

**Natural language (AI-powered):**
- `Gasté 150 en pizza` → AI understands and logs expense
- `50 dólares la cena con Gonzalo` → Sender + Gonzalo split it
- `5 lucas el taxi` → Understands "lucas" = thousands (5000 ARS)
- `pagué 200 de nafta` → Natural payment description

**Structured syntax (still works as fallback):**
- `100 taxi` → Logs expense, splits among everyone in group
- `USD 50 dinner @Juan @Maria` → Converts currency, splits ONLY among mentioned
- `50 cena @Yo @Juan` → Include yourself by mentioning your name

**Split logic ("con" vs "@"):**
- `50 cena con Juan` → Sender + Juan split it (natural language, "with")
- `50 cena @Juan` → Only Juan owes (explicit mention, logging for others)

**Payments:**
- `pagué 5000 @Maria` → Record payment made to Maria
- `recibí 5000 @Juan` → Record payment received from Juan

**Commands:**
- `/balance` → Shows who owes whom
- `/grupo` → Switch between groups
- `/lista` → View recent expenses
- `/ayuda` → Get help

**Edit/Delete:** Dashboard only at textthecheck.app (keeps bot simple)

### The Core Insight

> **Splitwise friction:** Everyone downloads app + creates account + joins group
>
> **Our solution:** ONE person creates group, friends just text. No app downloads.

## ✅ What's Built & Working

### AI Natural Language (December 2025)
- [x] Google Gemini AI integration for message parsing
- [x] Argentine Spanish slang support (lucas, k, mangos, birra, morfi, bondi)
- [x] Natural language expense entry ("gasté 150 en pizza", "50 dólares la cena con juan")
- [x] Smart split detection ("con Juan" = include sender, "@Juan" = only Juan)
- [x] Fallback to regex parser if AI fails or has low confidence
- [x] Confidence threshold (0.7) for AI responses
- [x] 5-second timeout with automatic fallback
- [x] **Confirmation flow**: AI expenses require "si" to save, "no" to cancel
- [x] **Member aliases**: AI receives nicknames for better recognition
- [x] **Unresolved name rejection**: Expense blocked if any name can't be matched
- [x] **Strict fuzzy matching**: 70% similarity required, prevents false positives

### WhatsApp Bot
- [x] Natural language expense entry (AI-powered)
- [x] Multi-currency (USD, EUR, BRL → ARS via DolarApi.com Blue rate)
- [x] @mention splitting with fuzzy matching (Fuse.js)
- [x] Commands: `/ayuda`, `/balance`, `/lista`, `/grupo`
- [x] Edit/Delete: Dashboard only (keeps bot simple, redirects to textthecheck.app)
- [x] Auto-categorization (food, transport, accommodation, etc.)
- [x] Multi-group support with `/grupo` switching
- [x] **Payment recording**: `pagué 5000 @Maria` or `recibí 5000 @Juan`
- [x] **Payment notifications**: Other party gets notified when payment is recorded
- [x] Security: webhook signature verification, rate limiting

### Web Dashboard
- [x] Google Authentication (linked to Firestore users)
- [x] **Create expenses via form** (amount, description, currency, participants)
- [x] Real-time expense feed
- [x] **Edit/Delete expenses**
- [x] **Unified activity feed**: Shows both expenses AND payments
- [x] Personal view ("Tu Resumen") vs Group view
- [x] Settlement recommendations
- [x] **Payment recording button**: Click settlement → "Registrar pago realizado"
- [x] Payment info with copy-to-clipboard
- [x] Group selector dropdown
- [x] Bottom navigation (mobile)
- [x] Profile page with payment details

### Infrastructure
- [x] Backend on Render (auto-deploy from GitHub)
- [x] **Cron job (cron-job.org)** - Pings server every 10 minutes to prevent cold starts
- [x] Frontend on Firebase Hosting
- [x] Custom domain: textthecheck.app
- [x] Firestore security rules

## 🔑 Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| AI Provider | Google Gemini 2.0 Flash | Cheap (~$0.02/month), fast (~800ms), good structured output |
| AI Fallback | Regex parser | Graceful degradation if AI fails/times out |
| Split detection | "con" vs "@" | Natural language includes sender, explicit @ does not |
| Exchange rate API | DolarApi.com | Free, has Blue Dollar, supports EUR/BRL |
| Fuzzy matching | Fuse.js | Lightweight, handles typos and accents |
| Auth | Google (Firebase Auth) | Simple, most users have Google |
| Multi-group | `activeGroupId` on user | Syncs between WhatsApp and dashboard |
| Currency display | Always ARS | Stored in ARS, original currency for reference |
| Hosting | Render (backend) + Firebase (frontend) | Free tiers, good DX |

---

## 📱 WhatsApp API Status

### Current: Test Mode
- Using Meta's test phone number
- Only ALLOWED_PHONE_NUMBERS can message the bot
- Works for testing with known friends
- Cannot scale to unknown users

### For Public Launch
- Need WhatsApp Business verification (1-4 weeks)
- Need dedicated phone number for bot
- Need approved message templates for outbound messages

---

## 🛤️ Roadmap

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Phase 1-4 | ✅ Done | Security, deployment, data quality, bot commands |
| Phase 5 | ✅ Done | Dashboard UX enhancements |
| **Testing** | 🔄 Current | Test with 3 friend groups |
| Self-service | ⬜ Next | Registration, group creation UI |
| Public launch | ⬜ Future | WhatsApp verification, remove whitelist |

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Gotchas

1. **Cold starts on Render:** ~~Free tier spins down after inactivity, first request can be slow~~ **SOLVED** - Cron job pings server every 10 minutes via cron-job.org

2. **WhatsApp test number:** Must manually add each phone to ALLOWED_PHONE_NUMBERS

3. **Google Auth domain:** Must add domains to Firebase Auth → Authorized Domains

4. **Multi-group users:** When user is in multiple groups, they must use `/grupo` to switch. Default is their `activeGroupId` or first group found.

5. **Emails optional:** Users can use WhatsApp without email. Email only needed for dashboard access.

6. **Argentina focus:** Currency conversion assumes ARS as target. Blue Dollar rate used.

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **WhatsApp API is not like Telegram:** You can't just let anyone message your bot. Meta controls access.

2. **The friction trade-off:** We reduced friction for expense logging but current onboarding requires developer. This is the main gap to fix.

3. **Test with real users early:** Many UX issues only surface with real usage (numbers getting cut off, confusing navigation, etc.)

4. **Documentation matters:** Keeping docs updated helped clarify product state for co-founder discussions.

## 🎯 Next Steps (As of December 30, 2025)

1. **Done:** Splitting logic redesign - payer not auto-included (see `docs/splitting-logic.md`)
2. **Done:** Payment recording feature - WhatsApp commands + dashboard button
3. **Done:** Activity feed shows both expenses and payments
4. **Done:** AI natural language parsing with Gemini (see `docs/ai-natural-language.md`)
5. **Done:** Smart split detection ("con" vs "@")
6. **Done:** AI expense confirmation flow (user must confirm with "si")
7. **Done:** Unresolved name handling (reject expense if names can't be matched)
8. **Test:** Real trip testing scheduled for January 2025
9. **Parallel:** Research WhatsApp Business verification process
10. **After testing:** Build self-registration and group creation features
